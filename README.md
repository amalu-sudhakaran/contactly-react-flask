# Contactly - An Online Phonebook Directory

Contactly is a simple online phonebook directory that allows users to store and manage contacts at a single place. It supports full CRUD functionality where users can add, edit, and delete contacts from the directory. The directory is public and can be accessed by anyone with the link.

The application is built using JavaScript for the frontend with React.js as the UI library and Python for the backend with Flask as the web framework.
